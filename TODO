===============

 * mini-dinstall only verifies the upload GPG signature,
   it does not check if the signer is allowed to upload
   the package in question.
     This could be achieved by extending the dinstall-pre
   script to perform a filtering based on package name and
   uploader key ID, or by switching from mini-dinstall to
   reprepro which supports such filtering.
