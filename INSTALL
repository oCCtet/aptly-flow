aptly-flow INSTALL
==================

No build is needed, as all the programs are written in
interpreted languages. At the moment 'make install' or
any other installer is not available either.

This document aims to give enough information for performing
a manual installation.

Depends:

  * mini-dinstall
  * aptly, version 0.9 or later
  * Perl, version 5.18 or later

Recommends:

  * vsftpd

Installation
------------

The recommended locations for local installation:

  * /usr/local/lib/dinstall/
       preinst  -> <path>src/dinstall-pre.pl
       postinst -> <path>src/dinstall-post.sh

  * /usr/local/bin/
       dinstall-key -> <path>src/dinstall-key.pl
       aptly-flow   -> <path>src/aptly-flow.pl

The -> indicates a symbolic link. The <path> indicates
the directory holding the aptly-flow code distribution.

Configuration
-------------

Aptly should be run as a dedicated user 'aptly', which can
be a non-system user for interactive user actions.

The mini-dinstall daemon should be run as a system user 'dinstall',
which is also the userid that shall own the uploaded files (as
granted by vsftpd configuration).

The examples directory holds example configuration files. The
config directory holds daemon control script and sudoers files.
