Aptly Flow
==========

The aptly-flow and friends is a collection of helper tools
that complement aptly <www.aptly.info> in Debian/Ubuntu
Archive maintenance.

The tools are:

  * aptly-flow

    Streamline selected tasks that are difficult (take a lot of
    steps) with the bare aptly. Most tasks require a suitable
    configuration in file ~/.aptly-flow.conf or /etc/aptly-flow.conf
    (an example file is in the doc/ directory).

  * dinstall-key

    Install debian packager/uploader GPG signing key into the
    mini-dinstall's (first) extra keyring. Runs sudo as needed;
    the user-to-run-as is read from the /etc/vsftpd.conf, and
    the extra keyring from the /etc/mini-dinstall.conf file.
    (Assumes that vsFTPd is used as the FTP server to provide
    the upload queue for the dput program.)

DISCLAIMER: The aptly-flow is not endorsed nor connected to
the aptly or its author in any way.
